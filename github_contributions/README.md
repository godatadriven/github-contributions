# github contributions dbt plugin

Be sure to install the github contributions plugin in edit mode via:

```bash
python -m pip install -e github_contributions
```

Also if you'd like to connect the Pycharm debugger, make sure your dbt entrypoint is the dbt installed in your venv, for instance:

```bash
./venv/lib/python3.10/site-packages/dbt/cli/main.py
```
